# EUCS - EU Cybersecurity Certification Scheme

EUCS (European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services) is the European cybersecurity certification scheme for cloud services, established under the European Cybersecurity Act.

## What is EUCS?

EUCS is a harmonized certification scheme at the European level that aims to create a common framework for assessing the security of cloud services across the European Union. It replaces and harmonizes existing national certifications.

## Certification objectives

- **European harmonization**: A single scheme recognized in all EU member states
- **Security levels**: Different assurance levels according to needs
- **Interoperability**: Facilitate trust and cross-border exchanges
- **Data protection**: Ensure GDPR compliance and digital sovereignty

## Security levels

EUCS defines three assurance levels:

1. **Basic**: Basic level for non-sensitive data and applications
2. **Substantial**: Substantial level for critical data and services (equivalent to SecNumCloud)
3. **High**: High level for critical infrastructures and highly sensitive data

## Evaluation criteria

- **Organizational security**: Governance, risk management, compliance
- **Physical security**: Protection of datacenters and infrastructures
- **Logical security**: Access controls, encryption, isolation
- **Operational security**: Incident management, business continuity
- **Regulatory compliance**: GDPR, NIS2, Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)

## Regulatory context

EUCS is part of the European regulatory ecosystem:
- **EU Cybersecurity Act** (2019): Legal framework for cybersecurity certifications
- **NIS2 Directive**: Resilience of critical infrastructures
- **GDPR**: Personal data protection
- **Data Governance Act**: Data governance in Europe

## Current status

⚠️ **Current status**: EUCS is being finalized by ENISA (European Union Agency for Cybersecurity). The scheme is expected to be adopted during 2025-2026.

Some providers are anticipating certification and preparing compliance with EUCS Substantial level requirements.
